		Currently, the UART is capable of sending image packets to the VGA and/or program packets to the StormCore.
		The processor is able to send data to VGA as image packets and/or UART as text for the user terminal.
		
# Operation
	
	StormCore:
		After a hard system reset, the processor program counter starts reading and executing instructions from address #0 on the program memory (MEMORY.VHD).
		The resulting program output is then sent to the GPIO_OUT register which is connected to the Local Port of the #00 node of the NoC.
		The StormCore instance starts off with a simple program designed to send packets to the VGA instance and the UART instance.
		
	NoC:
		A 2x2 ARKE NoC is present, connecting all the instances. One of the NoC nodes (#01) is left unconnected.
		Packets that go in the NoC must have a flit size of 8 bits and thus might need adjustment when working with larger frames.
		The first flit of a packet entering the network must contain the address node (Header) in the least significant bits (in the 2 LSBs in this case).
		The last flit of a packet to enter the network must drive a logical high in the end-of-packet (EOP) bit of the IP->NoC interface.
		The stall-go signal can be used IP-side to pause the communication when required. The NoC eventually stalls/goes an IP due to a variety of factors.
		
	VGA:
		The VGA works in two stages:
			->	When the device is able to draw, the VGA disables memory writing in it's pixel matrix and draws a full screen with the present memory image.
				During this stage the NoC is stalled if there any active packet transmissions to the VGA.
			->	When the device is busy and not able to draw, the VGA enables memory writing and communications proceed.
		These stages switch between each other during normal VGA operation.
		
		VGA's packet frame is as follows:
			
            | HEADER | STARTING COLUMN | STARTING LINE | HEIGHT | WIDTH | PIXEL PAYLOAD |
            |   8b   |        8b       |      8b       |   8b   |   8b  |     k x 8b    |
			
			k = HEIGHT x WIDTH
				
		Where:
			HEADER is the address of the VGA node in the NoC, #11 in this case.
			STARTING COLUMN and STARTING LINE represent the point where the image should begin to be drawn, with both #0 being the leftmost top pixel and both #255 being the rightmost bottom pixel.
			HEIGHT and WIDTH represent the size of the image in pixels. Maximum size is 256x256 for an image that starts at coordenates #0 (see the item above).
			PIXEL PAYLOAD carry the color data in each 8-bit flit. The VGA registers the image size (HEIGHT x WIDTH) and expects the PAYLOAD to be of equal size
			
		The VGA instance's memory has a preset data of a 256x256 pixels picture of Pamela Anderson in Baywatch attire.
	

# Simulation step-by-step:
	
	1. Open your choice simulation tool and compile all "src" folder files, along with the "SYSTEM_TB.vhd" file present in the "sim" folder. *********
	2. Find the testbench "system_tb" inside your work library and simulate it.
	3. Navigate the project hierarchy and locate the signals you wish to verify.
	****
	4. In simulation, two packets will be sent from the processor: one to UART and one to VGA.
	
	Notes:
		* A TCL script is provided (compile.tcl) in the "sim" folder for an automated first step; 
		* The preset StormCore program is expected to send data to both UART and VGA nodes.

# Synthesis step-by-step:
	
	1. Open ISE Design Suite and create a new project suitable for the FPGA you are using. The FPGA used in development was the SPARTAN 6 device XC6SLX16 package CSG324.
	2. Navigate to the Design tab. Right click on the project hierarchy area and choose the option "Add Source".
	3. Add all the VHDL files contained in the "src" folder and it's subfolders. Add the "bram_pam_256x256.txt" file in the src/VGA/ folder.
	4. Adjust the user constraints file (.ucf) to the FPGA you are using.
	5. Navigate in the hierarchy to the "SYSTEM - Structure" tab and click it. Below the project hierarchy a number of itens should appear.
	6. To execute the synthesis and design implementation, simply double-click the desired item in the window below the project hierarchy.
	7. After each step resolution, a '!' sign should replace the void space (as the step was completed successfully, but warnings were given).
	
			- Run the attached StormCore program "hello.c" through makefile. ($ make <file_name>.elf)
			- Run your custom StormCore program through the same step above.
			- Run the "bmp_to_serial" program to convert a .bmp file. ($ bmp_to_serial <file_name>.bmp <file_name>.bin)

# FPGA use step-by-step (following the synthesis step-by-step above):
	
	1. Generate the programming file by double-clicking "Generate Programming File". After completion, a bitstream file (<project_name>.bit) will be created in the project directory.
	2. Connect the FPGA to a VGA screen and to a computer's serial I/O, and then turn the FPGA on.
	3. Locate the bitstream file and apply the programming process (using a provided tool like Digilent Adept or another method like a flash drive).
	4. After the FPGA start up and programming processes, press the corresponding reset button on the kit.
	5. A picture corresponding to the text file included during synthesis should appear on screen. This file image is pre-loaded in the VGA memory.

	# Interacting with the programmed system step-by-step:
	
		1. Find out which serial communication port was attributed by the computer to the FPGA.
		2. Open your serial communication tool in your computer. Configure it to use a 115200 baud rate, no parity bit, 8 data bits and 1 (one) stop bit.
		3. Run the "hello.c" file through makefile ($ make <file_name>.elf).
		4. Using your serial communication tool, send the resulting file (program_uart.bin) as a text file.
